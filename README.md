Pig Game
This is a simple implementation of the Pig dice game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of the game is to be the first player to reach 100 points. Players take turns rolling a dice and accumulating points, but if a player rolls a 1, their turn ends and they lose all their accumulated points for that turn.

How to Play: 
> Click on the "New Game" button to start a new game.
> Click on the "Roll Dice" button to roll the dice. Each roll adds to your current score.
> Click on the "Hold" button to add your current score to your total score. Your turn ends and the other player takes over.
> If you roll a 1, your current score becomes zero and your turn ends.
> The first player to reach 100 points wins the game.
