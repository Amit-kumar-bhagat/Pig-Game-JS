Pig Game
This is a simple implementation of the Pig dice game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of the game is to be the first player to reach 100 points. Players take turns rolling a dice and accumulating points, but if a player rolls a 1, their turn ends and they lose all their accumulated points for that turn.

How to Play
To start a new game, click on the "New Game" button.
To roll the dice, click on the "Roll Dice" button. Each roll adds to your current score.
If you want to keep your current score and add it to your total score, click on the "Hold" button. Your turn ends and the other player takes over.
If you roll a 1, your current score becomes zero and your turn ends.
The first player to reach 100 points wins the game.
